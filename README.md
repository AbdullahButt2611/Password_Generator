This app will provide some settings to change the properties of the password. The property in which small letters are included is always checked and is disbaled for the user because the small letters are must to be included into the password. The GUI is already built in such a way that the user can't unselect the option. Once after selecting the options, the generate button is clicked then the system will generate some random password from those properties and the length of the password will be equal to the value we have selected from the slider. Also the password can be configured in such a way that the characters that are already used will not be used anymore. Also, if the length of the password is chnaged from the slider even then the password will be chnaged and a new password will be generated. The app will also display the power of the password through an indicator right below the pasword and the color is dependent on the length of the password.<br>
The user has also been provided the facility to copy the password through a single click. The copy icon will be changed to ticks to show that the password has been copied to the clipboard and then the user can use it.

### Features
<br>
Following are some of the new features and learning encountered while creating this amazing project:

- Removing the duplicate characters in the password generated through the following code
```
 if(excludeDuplicate)
 {   
     !randomPassword.contains(randomChar) || randomChar == " " ? randomPassword += randomChar : i--;
 }
 else
 {
     randomPassword += randomChar;
 }
```

- `.includes()` function has been used for checking the string for present characters instead of `.contains()` becuase it has been deprecated.
- Copying the data to the system's clipboard:
```
navigator.clipboard.writeText(passwordInput.value);
```
